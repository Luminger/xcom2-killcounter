TL;DR: Tactical UI now shows you how many enemies you've killed, the remaining
	   count and how many are currently active.

NEW: Now with MCM support! (Big thanks to Managarmr!)

This mod adds a set of (very) simple counters to the Tactical UI. It shows you
how may enemies you've killed so far, how many are remaining (or the total
count, this can be changed in the settings) and how many are currently activated
and after you (you can disable this in the settings if you dislike it).

This mod is open source: https://github.com/Luminger/xcom2-killcounter

It will only show the number of remaining enemies (or the total) in a mission
as long as you've already build the ShadowChamber (you can change this as
well in the settings).

So this mod doesn't show you anything which you didn't already know, but who
does exactly count how many aliens have been killed so far or how many are
currently active? While the total enemy count will go up whenever reinforcements
arrive, this also isn't something you didn't already knew (as long as you
counted fast enough). In case you dislike this, there's an option to
disable the total count. Same goes for the count of the currently active
enemies - technically not cheating, but somebody might dislike it -> tweak the
settings until you like it.

This mod is somewhat mature by now, so new features are rather unlikely to
appear out of nowhere, but please feel free to donate the code if you like;
I'm happy to have a look at improvements/features! I'll also do my best to
keep it working, but this may take a while as real life is a priority way
before XCOM.

Possible future features:
 - Show the names (and count) of each enemy type killed, maybe in a tooltip. If
   you have any other idea how to visualize this properly (I'm not a UI 
   designer) please leave a comment [LOW]
 - Give players the option to not count reinforcements into the total count
   (looks like this is way more complex than I though) [LOW]
 - Give players the option to disable the remaining/total count in story
   missions where the count is rather high and it adds to the 'thrill' of
   those missions. [LOW]
 - Aliens who bail out and join another pod will increase the Acrive counter.
   Technically this isn't something you knew, so it violates the key pricipal
   of this mod. It might be possible to detect a 'pod join', but it might be
   at least tricky or just not possible at all. [MEDIUM]

Features marked with [LOW] are questionable and might not be useful at all.
Please feel free to leave a comment if you do think a features marked as [LOW]
is worth implementing. Other suggestions are welcome as well!
