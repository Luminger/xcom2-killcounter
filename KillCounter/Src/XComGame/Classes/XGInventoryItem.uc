// NOTE: removed replication of slot, owner, size, etc as they are set via simulated functions.
// the reason for this was there were cases when the server would replicate the variable before the 
// client accessed the old, yet correct for the time, value and the client would get out of wack.
// if we need to replicate properties here we should look into doing it via the yet un-implemented bNetNewTurn condition. -tsmith
