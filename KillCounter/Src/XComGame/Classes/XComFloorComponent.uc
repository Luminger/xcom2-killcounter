/** XComFloorComponent 
 *  Overhauled 10/19/2012 - Jeremy Shopf
 *  
 *  The purpose of this component is to control transitions between a level actor's various visibility states. It
 *      effectively acts as a wrapper around level/frac level actors..
 *      
 *   The floor component only ticks when a transition for it's owner's primtivies is in progress. Note that the actual
 *      setting of the fade values are set by the renderthread in UpdatePrimitiveCutoutFade(). The floor component's job 
 *      is to make sure the state of the primitive (bCutoutMask, etc.) doesn't change until the fade is finished. */
