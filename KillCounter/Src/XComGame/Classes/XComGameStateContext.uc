//  PURPOSE: This is the base class and interface for an XComGameStateContext related to an 
//           XComGameState. The context is responsible for containing the logic and domain
//           specific knowledge to convert game play requests into new game states, and game
//           states into visualization primitives for the visualization mgr.
