Get a fresh copy from your SDK (or any other mod) and paste it here for
autocomplete. It won't be bundled into the resulting mod as it's marked (in
the properties of the folder in ModBuddy) as 'Build Action: None' (every
file).

It's a pitty that everybody deletes the files when they can be marked as
"don't distrubute" in the IDE...
