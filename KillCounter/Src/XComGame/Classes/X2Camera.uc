/// X2Camera is the mechanism by which the tactical game systems control and interact with the camera.
/// Systems that desire camera control should subclass X2Camera and implement the desired camera behavior,
/// then submit the camera to the X2CameraStack with X2CameraStack.AddCamera(). Do not worry if your camera
/// is not chosen by the stack, nor attempt to hack the stack to force your camera to be used. There is a
/// lot of interesting stuff to look at in XCom. Just set the desired priority type, and if you find that
/// insufficient, see David Burchanowski to work on a solution to the problem.
///
/// See X2CameraStack for more information on how this system is designed to work.

/// Please do NOT modify this class without talking to me (David B).
